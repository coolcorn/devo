title: Devo PTO Meeting for 2012-09-24
---
Devotion has 820 students among 39 classrooms. We're not quite sure how many families but the number 500 is often used.

Over the summer 15 professional staff members and 20 para-professional staff members were hired.

The PTO is merging with http://www.friendsofdevotion.org in that they will be a single non-profit that files a single tax return (but will keep separate books for now). The by-laws are available somewhere.

Per http://www.devotionschool.org/governance.php "Co-chairs for the 2012-13 school year are Christina Knopp, Deborah Lindeman, Cindy Tungate, and Charla Whitley... Our PTO treasurer for 2012-13 is Gregory Rogers." The PTO meets with the principal every two weeks and the superintendent every month.

Parents of absent students are newly called via computer system called [X2](http://www.follettsoftware.com/press.cfm?vPress=2640). Feedback was given that all phone numbers could be called, not just the home phone.

The "baseline assessment system" is given at the beginning and end of the year.

Anti-bullying via http://www.olweus.org and the Bullying Prevention Climate Committee (BPCC).

Each grade has a "team lead" that the principal can communicate with who will tell the other teachers for that grade.

The [Food Services page from the Brookline Schools webpage](http://www.brookline.k12.ma.us/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=192&Itemid=300) links to new regulations: http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/governance/legislation/comparison.pdf

The http://tinyurl.com/devopto Amazon affiliate link at http://www.devotionschool.org actually brings in a fair amount of money. Parents are encouraged to use it. No tracking goes on of purchases!

Room parents are still needed. Please see http://www.devotionschool.org/volunteer.php#room for details.

Tech parents are also needed to "help establish an online community and improve home-school communication" via platforms such as [Shutterfly](http://www.shutterfly.com/share-photos/classroom-websites.jsp), [Weebly](http://onceateacher.wordpress.com/2009/02/03/using-weebly-to-build-your-classroom-website/), or [Podio](https://podio.com). The idea is to standardize on a platform for consistency.

Someone to be in charge of Box Tops for Education is needed: http://www.devotionschool.org/volunteer.php#boxtops

There was some discussion of an "Angel Network" or "Wishlist Network" for families in need. A dedicated follow up meeting is expected.
