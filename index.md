The official website for the Edward Devotion School ("Devo") is http://www.devotionschool.org and there is a [website for Devo maintained by the Town of Brookline][town-site] and even a page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Devotion_School but this "devo" area of http://coolcorn.github.com is made by the parent of a Devo student.

This site features information about "Extended Day", which is technically known as the Devotion Primary Extended Day Program (DPEDP): http://coolcorn.github.com/devo/extended-day

It also covers the upcoming [renovation](renovation) of the school building.
